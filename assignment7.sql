A
As you know that 'Telco Card' is the most product in the Telco group (accounting for more
than 99% of the total). You want to evaluate the quality of user acquisition in Jan 2019 by the
retention metric. First, you need to know how many users are retained in each subsequent
month from the first month (Jan 2019) they pay the successful transaction (only get data of
2019). */
